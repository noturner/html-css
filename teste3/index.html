        My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I <br>
        Got out of bed at all <br>
        The morning rain clouds up my window <br>
        And I can't see at all <br>
        And even if I could it'll all be gray <br>
        Put your picture on my wall <br>
        It reminds me, that it's not so bad <br>
        It's not so bad <br>

        Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans" <br>
        This will be the last package I ever send your ass <br>
        It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it? <br>
        I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect <br>
        So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it <br>
        I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway <br>
        Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka <br>
        You dare me to drive? <br>
        You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night" <br>
        About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning <br>
        But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him? <br>
        That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning <br>
        Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy <br>
        And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call <br>
    </p>

        I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall <br>
        I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it <br>
        You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br>
        And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it <br>
        I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me <br>
        See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!<br>
        Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk <br>
        But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you <br>
        'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too <br>
        Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br>
        Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? <br>
        My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I <br>
        Got out of bed at all <br>
        The morning rain clouds up my window <br>
        And I can't see at all <br>
        And even if I could it'll all be gray <br>
        Put your picture on my wall <br>

        It reminds me, that it's not so bad <br>
        It's not so bad <br>
        Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy <br>
        You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? <br>
        Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that <br>
        And here's an autograph for your brother <br>
        I wrote it on the Starter cap <br>
        I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you <br>
        Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you <br>
        But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? <br>
        I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you? <br>
        You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling <br>
        To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br>
        And what's this shit about us meant to be together? <br>
        That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other <br>
        I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>
    </p>

        Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br>
        I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br>
        Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine<br>
        If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan<br>
        Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br>
        I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br>
        I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br>
        Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br>
        And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br>
        And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br>
        Come to think about, his name was, it was you<br>
        Damn!<br>
